# FizzBuzz

A simple, python-powered FizzBuzz app. I first encountered this challenge during my mock interview in class at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstartcoding.com">KickStart Coding</a>, which I failed magnificently at the time, lol! I hope this works!

- clone the repo
- in terminal run
    <code>python3 fizzbuzz.py</code>
